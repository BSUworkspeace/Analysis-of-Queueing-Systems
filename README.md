# Multidimensional Birth-and-Death Processes

- # waht about birth-and-death process
  The birth-and-death proc is $i_{t}, \quad t \geq 0$ is a special class of stochastic proc.the $i_{t}$ is number of customers in the system at time t

  We used "birth" to indicate the arrival and "death" to indicate the departure

  For here we consider a birth and death proc with a countable state space $\{0,1,2, \ldots\} .$ 
  - the matrix Q is infinitesimal coefficients
  - the matrix Q have three-diagonal structure
